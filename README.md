# C++ 00 to C++ 04 Modules

</div>

This repository contains the modules from the C++ piscine at 42 school. These modules progressively cover various aspects of object-oriented programming, including classes, inheritance, ad-hoc polymorphism, templates, and containers. Additionally, they provide a foundational introduction to C++ concepts such as namespaces, classes, member functions, standard I/O streams, initialization lists, and the use of static and const keywords.
